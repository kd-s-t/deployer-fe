Using Amazon Q Developer without an AWS Account [free]
AWS Builder ID: Sign up for a free Builder ID using any email. This does not require a full AWS account. After registering, users can log in to Amazon Q Developer in supported IDEs or the CLI using this Builder ID. This provides access to the Free Tier limits of Amazon Q Developer, including code assistance in many programming languages beyond AWS-specific tasks. Official Explanation
More information about Builder ID
Capabilities without AWS Account: Users with Builder ID get many of the same capabilities as with an AWS account, including multi-step agentic coding, conversational AI for code help, and security scans, but with lower usage limits (free tier). The Builder ID also grants access to AWS community forums and training via AWS Skill Builder.
Sign Up and Usage: Just sign up for a Builder ID, install the Amazon Q Developer plugin or CLI, and use the "Free Builder ID login" option in the plugin or CLI. No AWS account or billing info required.
Limitations: Without an AWS account, access to Pro tier features, advanced limits, or integrations (like IAM Identity Center SSO) is limited or unavailable, but the free tier is quite functional for individual and learning use.
Using Amazon Kiro without an AWS Account
Amazon Kiro is an AI IDE that can be downloaded and installed directly from kiro.dev. It does not require an AWS account to use.
Once installed, Kiro operates largely independently of AWS accounts but integrates with AWS tools optionally.
Users can explore spec-driven development, agentic code workflows, and other features locally without mandatory AWS cloud accounts.
➡️ Demonstrating Amazon Q Developer or Kiro is Compulsory
In your BUIDL submissions share screen shots, give context in your descriptions, show/comment/demo the tools in your videos. If you fail to show those tools & discuss how you leveraged them in your BUIDLs you will not be considered in the competition.

BUIDLs dont need all of these tools or even paid versions, the only requirements are 1/ installing 1 or more of the tools; 2/ demonstrating in your submissions how you leveraged the tools exactly, be creative the tools are powerful and can help generate ideas or build the entire product end to end and everything in between.
